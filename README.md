What have I learnt?
This week has been primarily about operators. 
1. Arithmetic Operator
2. Assignment Operator
3. Comparison Operator
4. Logical Operator
5. Bitwise Operator
6. Conditional Operator
I have also learnt how to apply these operators in JS code through the SDV-Week-3 practice repository. 

Why have I learnt this?
Understanding and applying operators are essential to using JS code. Learning operators are a good initial step into learning advanced JS code. 

How have I learnt this?
Through listening to lectures, reading through the given gitbook material and practing in VSC.   

What do I know now that I didn't know before?
I learnt how comparison operators actually work with the comparisons of datatypes vs the comparison of values and string converted values. 

What will I do to remember this learning?
Further practice and going back to the provided gitbook for reference.
